This model maps clinical entities and concepts to ICD-10-CM codes using `sbert_jsl_medium_uncased` sentence bert embeddings and it supports 7-digit codes with Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) status. It also returns the official resolution text within the brackets inside the metadata. The model is augmented with synonyms, and previous augmentations are flexed according to cosine distances to unnormalized terms (ground truths). 

In the result, look for the `all_k_aux_labels` parameter in the metadata to get HCC status. This column can be divided to get further details: billable status || hcc status || hcc score. For example, if `all_k_aux_labels` is like `1||1||19` which means the `billable status` is 1, hcc status is 1, and `hcc score` is 19.

text = &quot;&quot;&quot;Residual disease after initial surgery for ovarian cancer is the strongest prognostic factor for survival. However, the extent of surgical resection required to achieve optimal cytoreduction is controversial. Our goal was to estimate the effect of aggressive surgical resection on ovarian cancer patient survival.\n A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIC ovarian cancer undergoing primary surgery was conducted between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1998. The main outcome measures were residual disease after cytoreduction, frequency of radical surgical resection, and 5-year disease-specific survival.\n The study comprised 194 patients, including 144 with carcinomatosis. The mean patient age and follow-up time were 64.4 and 3.5 years, respectively. After surgery, 131 (67.5%) of the 194 patients had less than 1 cm of residual disease (definition of optimal cytoreduction). Considering all patients, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival; the need to perform radical procedures to achieve optimal cytoreduction was not associated with a decrease in survival. For the subgroup of patients with carcinomatosis, residual disease and the performance of radical surgical procedures were the only independent predictors. Disease-specific survival was markedly improved for patients with carcinomatosis operated on by surgeons who most frequently used radical procedures compared with those least likely to use radical procedures (44% versus 17%, P &lt; .001).\n Overall, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival. Minimizing residual disease through aggressive surgical resection was beneficial, especially in patients with carcinomatosis.&quot;&quot;&quot;

## Results

```bash

The results of this review suggest that aggressive ovarian cancer surgery is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence and a reduction in the number of radical versus conservative surgical resections. However, the results of this review are based on only one small trial. Further research is needed to determine the role of aggressive ovarian cancer surgery in women with stage IIIC ovarian cancer.

text = &quot;&quot;&quot;Clinical Guidelines for Breast Cancer:

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women. It occurs when the cells in the breast start growing abnormally, forming a lump or mass. This can result in the spread of cancerous cells to other parts of the body. Breast cancer may occur in both men and women but is more prevalent in women.

The exact cause of breast cancer is unknown. However, several risk factors can increase your likelihood of developing breast cancer, such as:
- A personal or family history of breast cancer
- A genetic mutation, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2
- Exposure to radiation
- Age (most commonly occurring in women over 50)
- Early onset of menstruation or late menopause
- Obesity
- Hormonal factors, such as taking hormone replacement therapy

Breast cancer may not present symptoms during its early stages. Symptoms typically manifest as the disease progresses. Some notable symptoms include:
- A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area
- Changes in the size or shape of the breast
- Nipple discharge
- Nipple changes in appearance, such as inversion or flattening
- Redness or swelling in the breast

Treatment for breast cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and the individual's overall health. Common treatment options include:
- Surgery (such as lumpectomy or mastectomy)
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- Hormone therapy
- Targeted therapy

Early detection is crucial for the successful treatment of breast cancer. Women are advised to routinely perform self-examinations and undergo regular mammogram testing starting at age 40. If you notice any changes in your breast tissue, consult with your healthcare provider immediately.

- Age (most commonly occurring in women over 50)
- Early onset of menstruation or late menopause
- Obesity
- Hormonal factors, such as taking hormone replacement therapy

Breast cancer may not present symptoms during its early stages. Symptoms typically manifest as the disease progresses. Some notable symptoms include:
- A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area
- Changes in the size or shape of the breast
- Nipple discharge
- Nipple changes in appearance, such as inversion or flattening
- Redness or swelling in the breast

Treatment for breast cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and the individual's overall health. Common treatment options include:
- Surgery (such as lumpectomy or mastectomy)
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- Hormone therapy
- Targeted therapy

Early detection is crucial for the successful treatment of breast cancer. Women are advised to routinely perform self-examinations and undergo regular mammogram testing starting at age 40. If you notice any changes in your breast tissue, consult with your healthcare provider immediately.

## Results

```bash

Overview of the disease: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women, occurring when the cells in the breast start growing abnormally, forming a lump or mass. It can result in the spread of cancerous cells to other parts of the body. 

Causes: The exact cause of breast cancer is unknown, but several risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing it, such as a personal or family history, a genetic mutation, exposure to radiation, age, early onset of menstruation or late menopause, obesity, and hormonal factors. 

Symptoms: Symptoms of breast cancer typically manifest as the disease progresses, including a lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area, changes in the size or shape of the breast, nipple discharge, nipple changes in appearance, and redness or swelling in the breast. 

Treatment recommendations: Treatment for breast cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and the individual's overall health. Common treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment of breast cancer.

Hello,I'm 20 year old girl. I'm diagnosed with hyperthyroid 1 month ago. I was feeling weak, light headed,poor digestion, panic attacks, depression, left chest pain, increased heart rate, rapidly weight loss, from 4 months. Because of this, I stayed in the hospital and just discharged from hospital. I had many other blood tests, brain mri, ultrasound scan, endoscopy because of some dumb doctors bcs they were not able to diagnose actual problem. Finally I got an appointment with a homeopathy doctor finally he find that i was suffering from hyperthyroid and my TSH was 0.15 T3 and T4 is normal . Also i have b12 deficiency and vitamin D deficiency so I'm taking weekly supplement of vitamin D and 1000 mcg b12 daily. I'm taking homeopathy medicine for 40 days and took 2nd test after 30 days. My TSH is 0.5 now. I feel a little bit relief from weakness and depression but I'm facing with 2 new problem from last week that is breathtaking problem and very rapid heartrate. I just want to know if i should start allopathy medicine or homeopathy is okay? Bcs i heard that thyroid take time to start recover. So please let me know if both of medicines take same time. Because some of my friends advising me to start allopathy and never take a chance as i can develop some serious problems.Sorry for my poor english😐Thank you.

I'm diagnosed with hyperthyroid 1 month ago. I was feeling weak, light headed,poor digestion, panic attacks, depression, left chest pain, increased heart rate, rapidly weight loss, from 4 months. Because of this, I stayed in the hospital and just discharged from hospital. I had many other blood tests, brain mri, ultrasound scan, endoscopy because of some dumb doctors bcs they were not able to diagnose actual problem. Finally I got an appointment with a homeopathy doctor finally he find that i was suffering from hyperthyroid and my TSH was 0.15 T3 and T4 is normal . Also i have b12 deficiency and vitamin D deficiency so I'm taking weekly supplement of vitamin D and 1000 mcg b12 daily. I'm taking homeopathy medicine for 40 days and took 2nd test after 30 days. My TSH is 0.5 now. I feel a little bit relief from weakness and depression but I'm facing with 2 new problem from last week that is breathtaking problem and very rapid heartrate. I just want to know if i should start allopathy medicine or homeopathy is okay? Bcs i heard that thyroid take time to start recover. So please let me know if both of medicines take same time. Because some of my friends advising me to start allopathy and never take a chance as i can develop some serious problems.Sorry for my poor english😐Thank you. &quot;&quot;&quot; val result = pipeline.fullAnnotate(text) Results What are the treatments for hyperthyroidism?
