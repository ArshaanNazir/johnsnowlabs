    <li>Keep: When this strategy is selected for an entity, De-identification Lab will leave the entity as it is. </li>
    <li>Mask: This strategy essentially allows the PHI entities to be replaced either the ENTITY NAME or replace with a fixed lenght of asterics (*) or replace with a same lenght number of asterics as the lenght of the entity.</li>
    <li>Obfuscate: This strategy allows the PHIs to be replaced with values that are semantically and linguistically similar. </li>
