## Overview-

</div>De-identification is a technique or process applied to a dataset with the goal of preventing or limiting certain types of privacy risks to individuals, protected groups, and establishments, while still allowing for the production of aggregate statistics - Introduction | NIST
De-identification is essential for companies working with sensitive and highly regulated data, such as health records, financial transactions, or personal information. De-identification of data can help companies reduce their risk of leaking or accidentally disclosing personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI). John Snow Labs' De-identification Lab has been build keeping in mind

- The ability to de-identify sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) using various techniques such as redaction, masking, tokenization, etc. 
- The ability to preserve the utility of the data for joining or analytics while reducing the risk of handling the data by obfuscating the raw sensitive identifiers. 
- The ability to comply with data privacy regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, etc. that require de-identification of data before sharing or processing.
